## Why
The current Staff Invaders level progression system lacks clear milestones and rewards for player achievement, reducing engagement and motivation for continued play.

## What Changes
- Enhance level progression to advance every 10 correct answers instead of variable milestones
- Add level-up visual and audio feedback to celebrate player achievements
- Improve difficulty scaling to provide smoother challenge progression
- Display current level prominently in the HUD with level transition effects
