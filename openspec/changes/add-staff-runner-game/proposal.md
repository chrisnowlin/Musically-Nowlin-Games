## Why
Staff Runner provides an engaging auto-runner platformer for note recognition that complements existing Staff Wars gameplay. While Staff Wars tests speed and accuracy under pressure, Staff Runner focuses on deliberate note identification through a platformer mechanic, creating a different learning pathway for music students.

## What Changes
- Add new Staff Runner game with auto-runner mechanics
- Implement note identification through on-screen button input
- Create progressive difficulty system with time limits and note range expansion
- Add visual feedback system with color coding and optional note names
- Implement stun mechanic for incorrect answers without life loss pressure

## Impact
- Affected specs: New capability `game-staff-runner`
- Affected code: New game component, routing, and game configuration
- Adds to existing music education game portfolio with complementary learning approach
