## Why
Build character recognition and melody association by identifying which animal's theme (leitmotif) is playing.

## What Changes
- Add a new game: Name That Animal Tune
- Define UX for playing a signature theme and selecting the matching animal
- Non-breaking addition with a small motif set

## Impact
- Affected specs: game-name-that-animal-tune
- Affected code: client/src/config/games.ts, client/src/games/name-that-animal-tune.tsx, client/src/lib/audio, client/src/components/ui, client/src/test
