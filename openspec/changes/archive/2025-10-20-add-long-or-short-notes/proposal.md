## Why
Introduce duration discrimination by comparing note lengths (long vs short) with simple visualizations.

## What Changes
- Add a new game: Long or Short Notes?
- Define UX for hearing two notes of different durations and choosing which was longer/shorter
- Non-breaking addition using envelope times

## Impact
- Affected specs: game-long-or-short-notes
- Affected code: client/src/config/games.ts, client/src/games/long-or-short-notes.tsx, client/src/lib/audio, client/src/components/ui, client/src/test
