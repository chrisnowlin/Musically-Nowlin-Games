## Why
Teach recognition of repeating melodic patterns and basic musical forms (ABA, ABAB) to support structural listening.

## What Changes
- Add a new game: Musical Pattern Detective
- Define UX for hearing a short melody and identifying its pattern form
- Non-breaking addition with simple phrase labels (A, B)

## Impact
- Affected specs: game-musical-pattern-detective
- Affected code: client/src/config/games.ts, client/src/games/musical-pattern-detective.tsx, client/src/lib/audio, client/src/components/ui, client/src/test
