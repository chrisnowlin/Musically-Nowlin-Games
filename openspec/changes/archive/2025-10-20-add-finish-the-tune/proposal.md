## Why
Teach melodic structure and pattern completion by letting learners choose the correct ending for a familiar tune.

## What Changes
- Add a new game: Finish the Tune
- Define UX for hearing a beginning phrase and selecting the correct ending
- Non-breaking addition with small set of nursery rhyme melodies

## Impact
- Affected specs: game-finish-the-tune
- Affected code: client/src/config/games.ts, client/src/games/finish-the-tune.tsx, client/src/lib/audio, client/src/components/ui, client/src/test
