## Why
Teach dynamics (loud/soft) discrimination to build listening skills around volume differences using familiar animal characters.

## What Changes
- Add a new game: Loud or Quiet Safari
- Define UX for hearing the same note at different volumes and selecting louder/softer
- Non-breaking addition using Web Audio GainNode

## Impact
- Affected specs: game-loud-or-quiet-safari
- Affected code: client/src/config/games.ts, client/src/games/loud-or-quiet-safari.tsx, client/src/lib/audio, client/src/components/ui, client/src/test
