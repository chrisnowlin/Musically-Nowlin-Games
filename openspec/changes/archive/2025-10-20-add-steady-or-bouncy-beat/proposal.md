## Why
Teach meter feel by contrasting steady marches (4/4) versus bouncy waltzes (3/4) and similar grooves.

## What Changes
- Add a new game: Steady or Bouncy Beat?
- Define UX for hearing short rhythmic feels and identifying the meter/groove
- Non-breaking addition with simple rhythm patterns

## Impact
- Affected specs: game-steady-or-bouncy-beat
- Affected code: client/src/config/games.ts, client/src/games/steady-or-bouncy-beat.tsx, client/src/lib/audio, client/src/components/ui, client/src/test
