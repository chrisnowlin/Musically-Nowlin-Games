## Why
Teach that melodies persist across timbres by asking learners to match the same tune played on different instruments.

## What Changes
- Add a new game: Tone Color Match
- Define UX for reference melody followed by choices played on different timbres
- Non-breaking addition using timbre variation

## Impact
- Affected specs: game-tone-color-match
- Affected code: client/src/config/games.ts, client/src/games/tone-color-match.tsx, client/src/lib/audio, client/src/components/ui, client/src/test
