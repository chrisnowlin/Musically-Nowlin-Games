- Define UX for playing/echoing sequences that grow in length after each success
- Non-breaking addition with simple pattern generation and input

## Impact
- Affected specs: game-musical-simon-says
- Affected code: client/src/config/games.ts, client/src/games/musical-simon-says.tsx, client/src/lib/audio, client/src/components/ui, client/src/test
