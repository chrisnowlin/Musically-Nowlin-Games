## Why
Introduce an auditory memory card game to strengthen melodic recognition and short-term memory through matching pairs of short melodies.

## What Changes
- Add a new game: Melody Memory Match
- Define minimal UX for flipping cards to hear melodies and matching pairs
- Non-breaking addition aligned with config-driven game registry

## Impact
- Affected specs: game-melody-memory-match
- Affected code: client/src/config/games.ts, client/src/games/melody-memory-match.tsx, client/src/lib/audio, client/src/components/ui, client/src/test
