## Why
Teach tempo discrimination by comparing faster versus slower performances of the same melody using playful racing visuals.

## What Changes
- Add a new game: Fast or Slow Race
- Define UX for hearing two versions at different tempos and choosing faster/slower
- Non-breaking addition with minimal audio tempo control

## Impact
- Affected specs: game-fast-or-slow-race
- Affected code: client/src/config/games.ts, client/src/games/fast-or-slow-race.tsx, client/src/lib/audio, client/src/components/ui, client/src/test
