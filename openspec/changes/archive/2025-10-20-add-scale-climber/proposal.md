## Why
Reinforce scale direction and melodic contour by having animals climb up or down while playing ascending or descending scales.

## What Changes
- Add a new game: Scale Climber
- Define UX for ascending vs descending playback with a ladder animation
- Non-breaking addition using basic scale generation

## Impact
- Affected specs: game-scale-climber
- Affected code: client/src/config/games.ts, client/src/games/scale-climber.tsx, client/src/lib/audio, client/src/components/ui, client/src/test
