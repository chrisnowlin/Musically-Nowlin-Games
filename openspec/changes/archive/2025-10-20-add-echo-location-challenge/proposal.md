## Why
Develop spatial audio awareness by asking learners to identify left/right (and later quadrants) based on stereo panning.

## What Changes
- Add a new game: Echo Location Challenge
- Define UX for directional sound playback and left/right selection
- Non-breaking addition using stereo panning

## Impact
- Affected specs: game-echo-location-challenge
- Affected code: client/src/config/games.ts, client/src/games/echo-location-challenge.tsx, client/src/lib/audio, client/src/components/ui, client/src/test
