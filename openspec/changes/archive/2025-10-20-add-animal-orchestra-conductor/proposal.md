## Why
Teach ensemble awareness and layering by allowing learners to start/stop parts and create simple textures/polyrhythms.

## What Changes
- Add a new game: Animal Orchestra Conductor
- Define UX for toggling parts (percussion, melody, harmony) and layering
- Non-breaking addition with simple mixing

## Impact
- Affected specs: game-animal-orchestra-conductor
- Affected code: client/src/config/games.ts, client/src/games/animal-orchestra-conductor.tsx, client/src/lib/audio, client/src/components/ui, client/src/test
