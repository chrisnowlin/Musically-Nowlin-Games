## Why
The current Staff Wars level progression system lacks clear milestones and rewards for player achievement, reducing engagement and motivation for continued play.

## What Changes
- Enhance level progression to advance every 10 correct answers instead of variable milestones
- Add level-up visual and audio feedback to celebrate player achievements
- Improve difficulty scaling to provide smoother challenge progression
- Display current level prominently in the HUD with level transition effects

## Impact
- Affected specs: game-staff-wars
- Affected code: client/src/components/StaffWarsGame.tsx, client/src/components/staff-wars/GameplayScreen.tsx, client/src/components/staff-wars/StaffCanvas.tsx
