Enable music education through {title}, a focused game that teaches {description.lower()} with immediate feedback and age-appropriate difficulty ({tier} tier). This game addresses the need for interactive, engaging music education that adapts to individual learner needs while maintaining pedagogical rigor.

## What Changes
- Add new game: {title}
- Implement game component following existing patterns (Game.tsx, StaffWarsGame.tsx)
- Add audio synthesis using audioService with Web Audio API
- Implement scoring system with progressive difficulty
- Add state management using React hooks (useState, useReducer)
- Implement accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- Add visual feedback with playful theme system
- Implement game configuration in games.ts registry
- Add routing in App.tsx
- Create game page wrapper component
- Add comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, accessibility)

## Impact
- Affected specs: game-{game_id} (new)
- Affected code:
  - client/src/config/games.ts (add game registration)
  - client/src/components/{title.replace(' ', '')}Game.tsx (new game component)
  - client/src/pages/games/{title.replace(' ', '')}GamePage.tsx (new page wrapper)
  - client/src/lib/gameLogic/{game_id}Logic.ts (new game logic)
  - client/src/test/{game_id}.test.ts (new test file)
  - client/src/App.tsx (add route)
- New dependencies: None (uses existing Web Audio API, React, Tailwind)
- Performance target: 60 FPS on modern browsers, <100ms audio latency
- Bundle size impact: ~15-20KB per game (lazy loaded)
