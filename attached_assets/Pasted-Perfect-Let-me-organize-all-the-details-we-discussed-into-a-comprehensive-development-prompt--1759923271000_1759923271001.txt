Perfect! Let me organize all the details we discussed into a comprehensive development prompt:

## Web App Development Prompt: High vs Low Sound Music Game

### Project Overview

Create an educational music web app for elementary school students (Kindergarten through 5th grade) that teaches the concept of high sounds versus low sounds through an interactive game.

### Core Concept

- Two animal characters each play a sound
- Students identify which character played the higher or lower sound based on a question prompt
- The animal characters should be consistent throughout the game but hold different standard orchestra instruments

### Technical Requirements

**Sound System:**

- Two-octave pitch range for sound selection
- Fixed pool of notes/pitches (no difficulty progression)
- Random selection from the pitch pool
- Standard orchestra instrument sounds
- Visual instruments displayed do not need to match the actual pitch/instrument sound being played

**Game Flow:**

1. Two animal characters appear, each holding an instrument
1. Both characters play their sounds sequentially
1. A random question prompt asks either “Which character played the higher sound?” OR “Which character played the lower sound?”
1. Student clicks/taps on the correct character
1. Feedback appears (green for correct, red for incorrect)
1. Score updates if correct
1. Game continues with new round

**User Interface:**

- Mobile-first design optimized for iPads and touch-capacitive TVs
- Large touch targets suitable for elementary-age children
- Responsive design that works across different screen sizes
- Touch sensitivity optimized for various devices

**Feedback & Scoring:**

- Simple visual feedback: Green indicator for correct answers, Red indicator for incorrect answers
- Running total score counter showing total correct answers (not consecutive streak)
- Reset button to clear score between sessions
- Keep feedback basic for initial version (can enhance later)

### Design Priorities

1. Child-friendly, engaging visuals
1. Clear, large interactive elements
1. Intuitive gameplay requiring minimal instruction
1. Consistent difficulty level across all uses

### Development Notes

- This is an initial draft/MVP - feedback system and additional features can be enhanced in future iterations
- Focus on core functionality: sound comparison, random prompts, basic scoring, and touch-friendly interface
