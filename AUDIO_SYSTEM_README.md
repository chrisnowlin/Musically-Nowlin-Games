## 🚀 Using in Your Games

### Example 1: Play a Note

```typescript
import { instrumentLibrary } from '@/lib/instrumentLibrary';
import { sampleAudioService } from '@/lib/sampleAudioService';

// Get sample path
const path = instrumentLibrary.getSamplePath('flute', 'C5');

// Load it
await sampleAudioService.loadSample(path, 'flute-c5');

// Play it
await sampleAudioService.playSample('flute-c5');
```

### Example 2: Load All Instrument Samples

```typescript
async function loadInstrument(name: string) {
  const paths = instrumentLibrary.getSamplePaths(name);

  for (const path of paths) {
    const sampleName = path.split('/').pop().replace('.mp3', '');
    await sampleAudioService.loadSample(path, sampleName);
  }
}

await loadInstrument('violin'); // Loads all violin notes
```

### Example 3: Get Instruments by Family

```typescript
// Get all woodwinds
const woodwinds = instrumentLibrary.getInstrumentsByFamily('woodwinds');
// Returns: [flute, clarinet, oboe]

// Get by animal character (for kids' games)
const bird = instrumentLibrary.getInstrumentByAnimal('Bird');
// Returns: Violin
```

## 📖 How It Works

1. **Game loads** → Initializes audio context
2. **Load samples** → Downloads MP3s into memory (background)
3. **Check availability** → Uses real samples if loaded, synthesizes if not
4. **Play audio** → Plays samples through Web Audio API
5. **Visual feedback** → Shows which mode is active

### Progressive Enhancement

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ No samples downloaded                 │
│ → Uses synthesized audio ✅          │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓ Download samples
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Samples downloaded                    │
│ → Uses real orchestra sounds ✨      │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Samples not loading?

**Check browser console:**
```javascript
// Should see:
✅ Loaded sample: flute-c5 (0.89s)
✅ Loaded 5 orchestra samples

// If you see 404 errors:
❌ Failed to load from /sounds/philharmonia/...
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify files in `client/public/sounds/` (not `client/src/`)
2. Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)

### No sound playing?

**Checklist:**
- ✅ Clicked "Start" button (required for Web Audio API)
- ✅ Browser volume not muted
- ✅ No browser errors in console
- ✅ Dev server running
