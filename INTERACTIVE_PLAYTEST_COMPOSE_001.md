## Observations

### ⚠️ Implementation Status

**Current State:** The game appears to be in **skeleton/minimal implementation** state:

**Evidence:**
1. **Generic Instructions:**
   - "melody mode" (lowercase, generic)
   - "Practice and master this skill." (very generic)

2. **No Specific Gameplay Elements:**
   - No composition interface visible
   - No note selection tools
   - No melody/rhythm/harmony input mechanisms
   - Only Correct/Incorrect buttons (self-assessment only)

**Comparison to Beat & Pulse Trainer:**
- Beat & Pulse Trainer had: BPM slider, specific instructions like "Keep a steady beat with the metronome", Start button
- Composition Studio has: Only mode labels and generic "practice" text

### Expected vs. Current Implementation

**Expected for Full Implementation:**
- Note selection interface
- Musical staff or rhythm grid
- Playback controls
- Composition tools (drag-and-drop notes, rhythm patterns, chord builders)
- Sample melodies/rhythms/harmonies to practice with

**Current Implementation:**
- Mode selection (functional)
- Self-assessment buttons (functional)
- Score tracking (functional)
- Generic placeholder text

## Assessment: NEEDS DEVELOPMENT

**Grade: C (Skeleton Implementation)**

**Strengths:**
1. ✅ Professional UI framework in place
2. ✅ Multi-mode architecture working
3. ✅ Clean design consistent with site theme
4. ✅ Score tracking functional
5. ✅ Mode switching capability
6. ✅ No console errors

## Recommendation

**Status:** ⚠️ **SKELETON - NEEDS FULL IMPLEMENTATION**

**Current State:**
- UI framework: ✅ Complete
- Game architecture: ✅ Complete
- Gameplay content: ❌ Missing

**Required Work:**
1. **Melody Mode:**
