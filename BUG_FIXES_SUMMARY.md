# Bug Fixes Summary

## Overview
Reviewed the Musically-Nowlin-Games codebase and identified and fixed **6 clear bugs** across multiple game components. All games tested with Playwright in headless mode - no UX issues detected.

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. **ToneColorMatchGame - Instrument Selection Bug** ✅
**File:** `client/src/components/ToneColorMatchGame.tsx` (Lines 182-194)
**Issue:** Double filtering of instruments array and inefficient array length calculation
**Problem:** Could cause undefined instrument selection when filtered array is empty
**Fix:** Cache filtered array and add bounds checking before array access

### 2. **ToneColorMatchGame - Missing Dependency** ✅
**File:** `client/src/components/ToneColorMatchGame.tsx` (Line 120)
**Issue:** `generateNewQuestion` called in useEffect but not in dependency array
**Problem:** Stale closure - function uses old state values
**Fix:** Added `generateNewQuestion` to dependency array

### 3. **RhythmPuzzleBuilderGame - Missing Dependency** ✅
**File:** `client/src/components/RhythmPuzzleBuilderGame.tsx` (Line 68)
**Issue:** `generateNewPattern` called in useEffect but not in dependency array
**Problem:** Stale closure - function uses old state values
**Fix:** Added `generateNewPattern` to dependency array

### 4. **StaffRunnerGame - Stale Closure Bug** ✅ **CRITICAL**
**File:** `client/src/components/StaffRunnerGame.tsx` (Lines 112-175)
**Issue:** `gameState.speed` read from OLD closure before state update
**Problem:** Notes move at incorrect speeds; speed calculation uses stale value
**Fix:** Calculate new speed before state update and use calculated value in callbacks

### 5. **RhythmEchoChallengeGame - Empty Array Bug** ✅
**File:** `client/src/components/RhythmEchoChallengeGame.tsx` (Lines 57-72)
**Issue:** Accessing `userTaps[0]` when array could be empty
**Problem:** Could result in NaN when subtracting undefined
**Fix:** Added guard for empty patterns before normalization

### 6. **ComposeYourSongGame - Array Bounds Bug** ✅
**File:** `client/src/components/ComposeYourSongGame.tsx` (Lines 166-180)
**Issue:** No bounds checking on array access
**Problem:** Could access undefined composition or note
**Fix:** Added guards to check for valid indices before accessing arrays
