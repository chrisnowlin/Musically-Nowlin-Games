      # Note: For actual staging deployment, you would deploy to a separate
      # environment like Vercel Preview, Netlify Deploy Preview, or a separate
      # GitHub Pages site. This workflow builds and validates the develop branch.
      #
      # To enable Vercel Preview deployments:
      # 1. Connect your repo to Vercel
      # 2. Vercel will automatically create preview deployments for branches
      #
      # To enable Netlify Deploy Previews:
      # 1. Connect your repo to Netlify
      # 2. Enable "Deploy Previews" in build settings
